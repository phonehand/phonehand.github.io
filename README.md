# phonehand.github.io

from last year (2016) github pages will serve only with https protocol.

so.. normal ws:// won't work anymore.. better to implement.. wss:// on amazonaws node.js server.

but, i don't know how to do it. and no time to expense any more.

so, moving all data to a new address. applecargo.github.io/phonehand.github.io

since, repositories made earlier than 2016. still available to be served with http protocol.

so, this repo won't be updated anymore. chao.
